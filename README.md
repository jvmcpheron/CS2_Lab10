## Introduction


One can do many things with a tree traversal as discussed in class.  In this lab, your job is to read two numbers, a low number and a high number. Then traverse the binary search tree to accumulate in a vector all of the values greater than the low number and less than the high number.

## What to Submit
Submit your solution as a CPP file. Give the file the name AssignmentTypeNumberLastNameFirstName.cpp (so, for example, my submission for Lab 3 would be named Lab3MaclinRichard.cpp). You should also include your first and last name in the file as a comment. Add a long comment in your code showing examples of the results produced from your code.
